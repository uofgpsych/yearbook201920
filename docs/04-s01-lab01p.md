**Title:** Does reading about climate change increase death thought accessibility? Integrating climate change communication with terror management theory

**Abstract:** Climate change (CC) communication commonly results in counter-productive bi-partisan attitude polarisation, which may be attributable to worldview defence mechanisms caused by heightened death awareness. This study for the first time examines whether exposure to threatening climate change information increases death thought accessibility (DTA), and whether increases in DTA can account for polarisation on a CC attitude measure. Participants read one of three news articles – discussing CC as a threat (threat), CC as a solvable problem (positive) or a CC unrelated topic (control). DTA was then measured using a word fragment completion task containing six ambiguous fragments that could be completed in either a death-related or a neutral way (e.g. COFF_ _ can be completed as COFFIN or COFFEE). Participants also indicated their attitudes towards government action against CC before and after reading the news article. We expect participants in the threat condition to show increased DTA and greater CC attitude polarisation than those in the positive or the control condition.
