**Title:** Investigating the impact of religious involvement on resilience and life satisfaction

**Abstract:** University students experience great stress, including academic pressure, relationship issues, and adjustment issues. Thus, they are more susceptible to psychological distress and mental health problems. Numerous studies have demonstrated that religion/ spirituality predict better mental well-being. Resilience and life satisfaction are crucial indicators of mental well-being, which will be examined in this study. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether religious involvement impacts university studentsâ€™ resilience and life satisfaction. Christians and individuals who are not committed to any religion were compared. Participants self-identify themselves in one of the groups and completed the online survey. It is predicted that Christians will have a higher level of resilience and life satisfaction than those without religion.
