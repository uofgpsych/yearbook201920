**Title:** ‘Don’t think about it’: A qualitative exploration of the experiences faced by Forensic Pathologists using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA).

**Abstract:** The work of Forensic Pathologists’ encompasses a variety of potentially stressful roles such as daily contact with the deceased, attending scenes of crimes, giving evidence in court and meeting with bereaved families. With a current lack of research and clinical attention given to the psychological well-being of Forensic Pathologists, the present paper aims to elucidate their professional experiences through Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). Due to the in-depth nature of IPA, a select group of 5 individuals were recruited as Forensic Pathologists from across the UK. Each participant was interviewed in-person by means of a semi-structured interview schedule and transcripts subjected to Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. Identified themes will cover topics such as stress, emotional detachment, reward and psychological well-being with verbatim quotes provided. Resultant themes will be discussed in the context of participants’ sense-making and the potential direction for future research.
