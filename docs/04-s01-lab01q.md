**Title:** An investigation of attitudes towards mental health conditions

**Abstract:** Literature has shown individuals with mental health disorders are highly subjected to being stigmatised by members of society. A recent study found the  stigmatisation of people with mental illnesses correlated with high levels of pathogen disgust. This potentially reflects humans may stigmatise as a result of a disease avoidance system which may be functioning in an over inclusive nature. As an extension to Dawydiak et al’s, (2019) study, the present research examined whether disgust sensitivity, specifically pathogen disgust, predicts stigmatising attitudes towards individuals with borderline personality disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, schizophrenia and a non-specified mental health disorder. 180 participants completed an online survey, which included fictional vignettes of each condition, the Three Domain Disgust Scale (TDDS),  and the  Attribution (27-item) Questionnaire. Stigmatisation was analysed using a general linear mixed-effects model, with scores from the TDDS entered as fixed factors, and participant and vignette entered as random factors.
