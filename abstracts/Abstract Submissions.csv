"Parents’ perceptions of their children’s trichotillomania, self-blame, and expressed emotion.","DAWYDIAK, Eugene",TALK,Individual Differences##Mental Health and Wellbeing,"<p></p><p>This study investigated the
relationship between parents’ self-blame for their children’s trichotillomania
(TTM) and expressed emotion towards the child. The aim was to see whether
parental self-blame for their children’s TTM could predict their expressed
emotion towards the child. Subjective perceptions of TTM severity and knowledge
were also analysed with respect to self-blame and expressed emotion. This is
the first study to investigate these relationships in parents with hair-pulling
children. Participants were recruited online and completed a series of short
questionnaires. Data was analysed using linear regression models and
correlational analyses in R. Results indicate that there is a fairly strong,
significant predictive relationship between self-blame and expressed emotion. Moderate
correlations were also found for subjective TTM severity and self-blame and EE.
However, TTM knowledge showed no significant effect on the outcome variables. Post-hoc
power analyses further showed that most findings were powerful at the .8 level.</p><br />",,Chiara Wilke,2244345w
The Lived Experience of the Relationship Between Parenting and Leadership,"BUSHNELL, Ian",TALK,Social Psychology##Applied Psychology##Other,"<p><span lang=""en-gb"" xml:lang=""en-gb"">The large amount of literature on parenting
suggests that it can be measured and generalised. However, qualitative papers
claim that especially motherhood is a highly individual experience, influenced
by a variety of factors. Furthermore, while the topic combines aspects of
identity theory, attachment, and even transformational leadership, there is
hardly any research linking the domains. Thus, the present study has chosen to
deeper explore the lived experience of the relationship between parenting and
leadership, basing its findings on four interviews with mothers in leadership
positions in academia. It uses an interpretative phenomenological analysis and
will base the findings’ evaluation mainly on identity theory, as it will also
be looking at the influences of both identities on each other. Congruent with
its methodology, conclusions will strongly rely on the participants’
experiences and sense-making thereof.</span><br /></p>",,Kim Rosenberger,2262149r

Investigating Empathy and Social Views Towards Male-to-Female Sexual Violence ,"MARTIN, Margaret",TALK,Social Psychology,"<p><b></b></p><p dir=""ltr"">Sexual violence is a prevalent issue, with male-to-female sexual violence considered the most pervasive. Rape myth acceptance (RMA) continues to impact considerations of what makes sexual violence acts ‘legitimate’ and not the fault of the victim. However, crime statistics have found that most cases do not have many RMA components. Data was collected via the online platform, Experimentum. Vignettes depicting rape in varied alignment with RMA components were administered to participants (n=165*). Participants were asked to identify whether they consider the scenario to be a rape in order to ascertain the effects of RMA.The Liberal Feminist Attitude and Ideology Scale (LFAIS) and the Rape Victim Empathy Scale (REMV) were completed to assess attitudes towards women and towards rape victims, respectively. It is hypothesised that those who scored higher on the LFAIS and the REMV measures will be more likely to definitively assess the vignette scenarios as depicting rape.</p><br /><br />",,Julie Farish,2085412f

An Investigation of the Effect of Lecture Recording Usage and Note-Taking on Recall,"NORDMANN, Emily",TALK,Educational Psychology,"<p>Note-taking is a key part of studying for many students, but it is not the only method of revision – as more lectures are recorded, their use is also rising. It is important to understand how these aspects of the revision process interact with each other, which (to our knowledge) has not yet been a focus of research. This study exists to investigate whether note-taking styles and strategies for lecture recording usage have any impact on memory. Participants each watched a TEDx talk and took notes using one of two strategies, and were then asked to complete a free recall task followed by a questionnaire. Their results were then analysed and compared by group, in order to see whether or not using the Cornell note-taking method and being allowed to pause lecture recordings to make notes would have an impact on recall.<br /></p>",,Calum Lindsay,2261159l

(a breath-awareness task) and ratings of emotions. Participants were asked to
complete the Five Facets of Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) and the Situated
Assessment Method (SAM²). They were

emotional valence and arousal. Finally, participants were asked to be aware of
their breathing for ten minutes, and to press a clicker each time they lost
this awareness. Results will be analysed to determine any correlations. It is
expected that there will be little agreement between the FFMQ and SAM²,

Expertise differences in emotion identification from dance movement in point light displays. ,"POLLICK, Frank",POSTER,Cognitive Psychology (including language),"<p></p><p>Expertise in
ballet dance has been shown to enhance the ability to discriminate emotions
expressed through dance (Christensen et al., 2016). A possible theory for why
expertise affects emotion perception is that experts’ extensive visual exposure
to specific movement selectively enhances their sensitivity to cues expressed
in dynamic display, creating schematic expectancies. Hence, the current study
compares expertise group differences between dancers and non-dancer of visual
attention for body regions of interest in an emotion-identification task using
Point Light Displays of whole-body dance movement. Participants were asked to
complete the Dance Sophistication Index, the Toronto Empathy Questionnaire, and
the AQ-10. They were then asked to watch Point Light Displays of a dancer and
indicate whether they perceived the movement to be neutral, sad, happy, angry,
or fearful. A binary logistic regression will be used to look at the
relationship between expertise, empathy and eye movements on perception of
emotion. </p><br />",,Elinor Tipper,2233973t
Information Targeting Justifications for Meat Eating and Plant-Based Food Intake Affects Food Shopping Behaviour,"PAPIES, Esther",POSTER,Other,"<p>Introduction:</p><p>Humans eat more meat now than ever before despite concerns for animal well being in factory farms, evidence that meat eating is detrimental to human health, contributing to the development of diabetes, stoke, heart disease and cancer, and research showing that animal agriculture is a large contributor to climate change. Conversely, plant-based foods have been found to reduce the risk of and even reverse the development of such diseases and are far more ethical and sustainable to farm, yet are eaten far less than meat. Consequently, measures must be taken to attempt to reduce meat-eating and increase plant-based food consumption. While informing individuals of ethical, health and environmental issues has been found to reduce meat eating, these effects have been limited as only 8% of the global population eats a meat-free diet. Additionally, few measures have been effective in increasing consumption of plant-based foods and meat-alternatives.</p><p><span>The 4N scale was developed to identify the primary rationalisations people use to align their beliefs and attitudes with their choice to continue consuming meat in light of the evidence above and found that these rationalisations are, that meat-eating is natural, necessary, normal and nice.

Transferring Conversational Facial Expressions onto a Social Robot Head ,"JACK, Rachael",POSTER,Social Psychology##Applied Psychology##Other,"<p></p><p>As social robots become increasingly popular in today’s society, there is
a need for them to be equipped with tools to effectively communicate with
humans– such as appropriate facial expressions. While in the past most research
focused on the facial expressions of emotions, conversational facial
expressions communicating messages such as “confused”, “bored”, “thinking” or “interested”
are arguably more frequently used in daily interactions and play a crucial role
in them, so much that their absence can impair comprehension and conversation
flow. This study aimed to transfer a set of these 4 common conversational facial expressions, reverse-engineered
through novel data-driven methods, to a popular
social robot head. To
achieve this, we recruited a set of participants to judge models of these
expressions displayed on the robot in a signal detection verification

The effect of decentering on the link between consumption simulation and bodily responses to food cues,"PAPIES, Esther",TALK,Mental Health and Wellbeing##Other,"<p></p><p>Decentering, a
component of mindfulness, has been proposed to help people experience less
cravings. According to the theory of grounded cognition, decentering weakens the
effect of consumption simulations on conscious desire and bodily responses like
salivation. Based on recent suggestions, this effect might even be stronger for
domain-specific decentering focused on food thoughts. However, inconsistent
findings have raised questions about the potential of decentering. The current
study addressed these inconsistencies by having participants (n = 96) listen to
audio instructions for general decentering, food-specific decentering and normal
viewing (control). Afterwards, they provided saliva samples while looking at
crisps and indicated their degree of consumption simulation. Two robust ANCOVAs
found consumption simulations to significantly predict crisp salivation. However,
no significant differences of this relationship were found between the three instruction
types. These findings question the effectiveness of decentering in weakening
the relationship between consumption simulations and salivation. </p><br />",,Hanna Glandorf,2268882g
“The cross-word effect”: A retrieval advantage for words encoded in line with their spatial association,"SCHEEPERS, Christoph",TALK,Cognitive Psychology (including language),"<p></p><p><span lang=""en-gb"" xml:lang=""en-gb"">Challenging

population and high social media use, however few studies have explored this
relationship in first-year students. 
This population experience high pressure to stay connected socially at
all hours of the day, and therefore factors that influence their sleep quality
should be explored.  As there are also
relationships between personality and sleep quality and personality and social
media use, this study aims to explore which personality traits might predict both
social media use and sleep quality in first-year students.</p>

Awareness and willingness to accommodate autistic students in higher education,"HORLIN, Chiara",TALK,Educational Psychology,"<p></p><p>The aim of this mixed-methods study was to examine the current autism knowledge and awareness in higher education teachers, as well as their attitudes towards accommodating autistic students. Educators from UK universities filled out online knowledge and awareness questionnaires. Furthermore, semi-structured interviews were conducted to explore their attitudes towards autistic students. The researchers are expecting to find medium to high ratings for both awareness and knowledge, and hypothesise that gender, knowing someone autistic, years spend teaching and autistic traits influence these scores. The qualitative analysis suggests cognitive dissonance between the often-positive attitudes towards accommodating autistic students, and the teacher’s actions in the classroom. On the basis of these results, it will be discussed how autism knowledge and awareness are high in teaching staff, which then however does not necessarily translate to inclusive teaching. The implications of this for higher education institutions and further research opportunities will be explored. </p><br />",,Rhoda von Below,2266645v
How does plain packaging influence desire for sugary drinks? The role of social identity theory and conspicuous consumption,"PAPIES, Esther",POSTER,Other,"<p>This study aims to assess whether plain packaging can reduce likelihood
to consume sugary drinks. Previous research examining plain packaging for
tobacco use has found the intervention to be successful, but less research has
been carried out looking at this intervention for sugary drinks and results are
inconclusive. Therefore, this study aims to resolve findings and examine the
role of social identity theory in the choice of branded versus plain packaged
sugary drinks. Participants were allocated to one of three conditions- branded
packaging, plain-transparent packaging or plain-opaque packaging. Likelihood to
choose scores for each condition were calculated as an average over 6
statements (3 public and 3 private scenarios). Results were analysed using a
mixed design ANOVA. It was concluded that participants were more likely to
choose sugary drinks in public versus private settings, and packaging type and
scenario did not interact to reduce participants likelihood to choose sugary

Investigating whether there is perceptual bias in mental time travel and whether this influences long-term visual predictions ,"MUCKLI, Lars",POSTER,Cognitive Neuroscience,"<p></p><p>Mental
time travel is a phenomenon whereby memory allows humans to revisit the past
and predict the future. However, there is little understanding of whether prior
information affects our ability to mentally time travel. Therefore, this
project will investigate whether there is a perceptual bias in mental time
travel and how this might affect long-term visual predictions. A previous
experiment investigating whether familiarity affected visual predictions in mental
time travel was analysed to identify the optimal amount of prior information
required to accurately mentally time travel.  Participants viewed frames from four videos
of walking routes. A blank period occurred after either 5-35 frames were shown,
and participants were asked to ‘mentally simulate’ the walking route. When the
video re-engaged, participants performed a 2-alternative forced-choice task to
indicate whether the frame shown was earlier or later in time of where they were
in their mental simulation. A 2-way repeated-measures ANOVA and t-tests
revealed that visual predictions were more precise remembering the past than
predicting the future. Although no significant effect was found between the
amount of prior information and accuracy in mental time travel, it was evident
that a lower number of frames shown before a response trial resulted in higher
accuracy in predicting the future.</p><br />",,Rebecca Griffith,2236162g

Saccadic Suppression: An Active or Passive Source?,"FRACASSO, Alessio",POSTER,Other,"<p><span></span></p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""font-weight:bold;"">Abstract </p><p dir=""ltr"">Humans typically perform around three eye movements per second in natural conditions, producing shifts that should result in blurring. However, visual sensitivity is suppressed in a phenomenon called saccadic suppression. Debates over the last 20 years have produced two origins for this phenomenon, one passive in which suppression is explained by temporal masking and retinal process during saccade execution, and a second, active in which extraretinal signals during preparation suppress processing centrally. This study aimed to investigate whether saccadic suppression is not only a function of execution but is involved in the planning of eye movements, by introducing saccadic inhibition to a classic saccadic suppression paradigm. Inhibition was shown to decrease the effects of saccadic suppression, providing support for an active origin, though further research is required to investigate how exactly this occurs. </p>",,Oisean Burnett,2237890b

determine if intelligence and grit are predictors of how skilled one is in a
video game that does not require a lot of mechanical skill. Each participant
was asked to complete a short questionnaire on grit followed by a short intelligence
test. Then, they were asked to complete a few levels from the game Portal 2, a
puzzle-based game, with each level representing a unique challenge involving
the placing of portals and blocks with the final goal of opening a door to be

Investigating cross-cultural differences in deception detection,"BUSHNELL, Ian",TALK,Social Psychology,"<p></p><p>Deception detection is a primary evolutionary behaviour that
is incorporated in many aspects of life (Mokkonen and Lindstedt, 2015).

Face Recognition Test: How Good is Your Face Memory? ,"LAGES, Martin",POSTER,Cognitive Psychology (including language),"<p></p><p>This study examines the impact of semantic information on the ability to recognise face images. The between-subject design equally split 30 participants into 2 conditions: names and pseudowords. Pseudowords contain little semantic information and cannot be visually represented, therefore they are more difficult to encode and retrieve successfully in long term memory. In addition, it is commonplace to associate a face and name because they can be phonologically and visually represented. It is hypothesised that face images will be better recognised when paired with a face. Participants were assessed on their total accuracy of recognition, response time and confidence that their response was correct during an old/new recognition test of 100 face images. The results were analysed using t-test and will be further analysed using logistic regression. The results, so far, suggest that face images paired with a name were recognised significantly better than face images paired with a nonword. </p><br />",,Laura McCabe,2263035m

differential decay rates in access and phenomenal consciousness,"HARVEY, Monika",POSTER,Cognitive Psychology (including language),"<p></p><p>Our study aims to investigate the nature of decay rates in
phenomenal and access consciousness, these being what having an experience feels

and then are asked to report both the cued letter and the colour diversity of
the whole array. 15 participants were tested across 2 sessions, in session 1 we
manipulated the delay between stimulus offset and the cue being given, in order
to compare the decay of colour diversity and cued letter information. In session
2 instead of asking for a colour diversity judgement we asked participants to
recall as many letters as they could from the array, in order to compare decay
rates of this maximum letter information to colour diversity.</p><br />",,Iain Mckirdy,2198685m

Bridging the gap between experimental and theoretical approaches in environmental psychology: An intervention on household food-waste-related behaviours in university students.,"ROUSSELET, Guillaume",TALK,Social Psychology,"<p></p><p>Increasing global environmental concerns call for radical changes in detrimental human behaviours. Environmental psychology has shown promise in mitigating such behaviours; however, findings from experimental and theoretical research approaches seldom intersect within this field. That is, interventions are rarely grounded in theoretical knowledge. The current study devised a psychologically informed intervention based on the integrative influence model of pro-environmental behaviour. In accordance to the model’s predictions of behaviour, the intervention aimed to modify Scottish university students’ perceptions of domains surrounding household food waste, namely perceived environmental consequences; ascription of responsibility; ability to prevent and social norms. Measurements of perceptions and food waste-related behaviours were collected through baseline and follow-up questionnaires online. The intervention was presented as a flyer within the baseline questionnaire. ANCOVAs compared the result of the intervention flyer group to a group presented with a basic informational flyer lacking social norm manipulations, and another presented with no flyer.  </p><br />",,Elisa Serra,2248867s
The Effect of Tattoo Narrative on Tattoo Stigma in the Workplace,"MARTIN, Margaret",POSTER,Social Psychology,"<p>

</p><p>Though there is much research indicating that visible
tattoos lower an individual’s professional desirability, there is as yet no
research measuring which genres of tattoo elicit the most stigma in the
workplace. This study compares professional desirability of tattooed surgeons
across six tattoo narrative genres: <i>Group-Association; Aesthetic; Message-to-oneself;
Self-Empowerment; Loss</i> and <i>Trauma.</i> Participants (N = 217) read a vignette
describing a hospital visit for a routine outpatient surgery, followed by 20
descriptions of doctors with upper-arm tattoos. Participants indicated on a
Likert scale how likely they would be to want each doctor as their surgeon. Data
was firstly analysed using Friedman’s Test, where professional desirability was
found to differ significantly amongst tattoo narratives. Post Hoc analysis
revealed that <i>Group-Association</i> tattoos were significantly less-desirable
than all others, and <i>Trauma</i> was significantly more desirable than most. Effect-size
was, however, small. A Wilcoxon Rank-Sum showed no significant difference due
to participant age. </p><p>

Dark Tetrad of personality; influence on academic majors and vocational interests,"WILSON SMITH, Kevin",TALK,Social Psychology##Other,"<p></p><p><br /></p><p>The Dark triad of personality (Machiavellianism, narcissism, and
psychopathy) are distinct, yet related traits that are socially malevolent
(Paulhus and Williams, 2002). The Dark triad has been implicated to influence
vocational and academic choices. Individuals with higher dark triad traits
place emphasis on attaining power, status, money and admiration and are
therefore drawn towards enterprising, artistic or realistic vocations that
facilitate achievement of such personal gains. Such individuals are also averse to vocations that
do not benefit them but rather involve social interactions or helping other individuals (Lee et al., 2013).  On an academic level, business and law
students score higher on the Dark Triad in comparison to psychology or
life-science students as these majors aid the pathway to their ideal career
that most aligns with their personality (Vedel and Thompson, 2017). The current
research aims to elucidate whether aforementioned findings can be extended to
the Dark tetrad; sadism in addition to the triad. It was hypothesized that
individuals within business/law degrees will score higher on the tetrad
indicated by a global Dark tetrad index, in comparison to psychology students.
Moreover, they will prefer artistic, enterprising or realistic vocations and be
averse to social vocations due to perceived career bias (Jonason et al.,
2014). Participants (n = 219), comprised
of university students, were administered with short dark triad (SD3) and
varieties of sadistic tendencies (VAST) questionnaires. Result analysis will
utilize one-way ANOVAs and post-hoc TukeyHSD and are to be confirmed. </p>

Subjective Decision Confidence Within a Perceptual Decision-Making Task: The Influence of the Speed-Accuracy Tradeoff,"PHILIASTIDES, Marios",POSTER,Other,"<p></p><p>Decision making within everyday life involves the judgement of when to stop deliberating and come to a decision, which is known as the speed-accuracy tradeoff (SAT). Subjective decision confidence is an endogenous evaluation of how accurate a decision was, which is used to inform future decision processes. This study examines, for the first time, how the SAT influences decision confidence within a perceptual decision-making task. The SAT was implemented by restricting the amount of time participants could view a random dot motion task before having to submit an answer as to which direction the dots were moving in. Within each condition, three levels of task difficulty were implemented by manipulating the percentage of dot coherence within the random dot-motion task. Once a decision was made, participants would rate their subjective confidence in their decision using a 9-point Likert scale. The results were analysed using ANOVA to confirm the implementation of the SAT, whilst a kolmogorov-smirnov test was used to compare the confidence distributions between the two conditions.</p><br />",,Tristan Smith,2259275s

eustress during the recreational circus activity of flying trapeze and its
effects on student well-being and self-efficacy. The aims of the study were to
investigate the experience of eustress during flying trapeze, how individual
differences may affect the experience of eustress and the impacts that eustress
may have on student well-being and self-efficacy. 91 University of Glasgow
students took part in a 2-hour flying trapeze workshop. The current study
utilised questionnaires at different time points throughout the workshop to
measure eustress-distress and individual differences.  Heart rate and blood pressure were measured throughout the study to indicate physiological
stress. Follow-up questionnaires were administered to investigate change
in well-being and self-efficacy. Data was analysed using descriptive
statistics, Spearman correlations and simple linear regression in R. Results
indicate that individuals experience eustress during the activity of flying
trapeze. Spearman correlations indicated that there was a significant negative
relationship between an individual's well-being and self-efficacy at the
beginning of the workshop and the level of eustress experienced. A simple linear
regression showed no significant effect of eustress on change in well-being and
self-efficacy from before the workshop to 1-3 weeks’ post-workshop. </p> <br />",,Mhairi Kristoffersen,2255377k

An important attribute we try to infer from people’s faces is trustworthiness. The current study aims to investigate the link between facial social categorisation properties, specifically sex and race on trustworthiness. In the experiment, participants viewed faces of people who have previously engaged in an economic decision making game. Their task was to guess how likely these people were to reciprocate half of the money invested in them. The results were analysed using a generalized linear mixed model.  As hypothesised,  Female faces were perceived as more trustworthy, compared to Male faces. Moreover, Asian faces were perceived as more trustworthy, with Caucasian participants exhibiting a larger trustworthiness difference between race stimuli. Additionally, trustworthiness reaction times were analysed, revealing no difference between sexes, but a significantly faster reaction time exhibited by Asian participants<br /></p>",,Ana Skolaris,2262784s
"“I can’t shut down feelings, there’s no time scale for them”: How ChildLine counsellors make sense of and cope with high-risk contacts","STACK, Niamh",TALK,Mental Health and Wellbeing##Applied Psychology,"<p>This is a phenomenological investigation of ChildLine counsellors' experiences when working with high-risk contacts. Working with high-risk children and young people has potentially negative psychological impacts for counsellors. Effective coping mechanisms have been identified as necessary in mitigating against these impacts. Coping mechanisms used by counsellors have mostly been quantitatively analysed. Hence, there is empirical opportunity to understand the underlying mechanisms of these coping processes as this may inform support structures for counsellors. Therefore, the aim of this study is to qualitatively analyse the mechanisms that counsellors use to cognitively appraise and cope with high-risk contacts. An audio diary methodology was adopted to access counsellors’ sense-making processes and capture the phenomena of coping as it developed. It was expected that this would expose the connection between how counsellors evaluate the success of a contact and the subsequent coping necessary to move forward from it.                       <br /></p>",,Mary Wilson,2200214w
The influence of emotional prosody on language comprehension ,"BARR, Dale",TALK,Cognitive Psychology (including language),"<p></p><p>This
study investigated whether emotional prosody aids resolving ambiguity, and
whether affective prosody provides a cue that is immediately used by listeners
in language comprehension. To do so, the researcher designed an experiment
using homophones. These are words pronounced in the same way but with different
spellings and meanings. Therefore, they create ambiguity in the listeners.
Given that some of the meanings of homophones have a stronger affective valence
compared to the respective ones (e.g. mousse/moose), the homophones were
divided into three categories (happy/sad/neutral). In the experiment, participants
heard commands (e.g. Click on mousse) expressing either an emotional
prosody (happy/sad) or a neutral one. The recordings were either emotionally congruent
or incongruent with the target homophone. Additionally, volunteers saw on the
screen four images, two representing each meaning of the homophones and two
distractors. Participants were told to click on the image they thought it was
mentioned. Fixation time and eye gaze were recorded through the eye-tracking
device. The data were analysed using ANOVAs. The researcher expected to see a
difference in eye gaze and fixation time depending on whether the prosody was congruent
with the target homophone or not.</p>

The Influence of Social Media on Mental Wellbeing and Social Identity,"WILSON SMITH, Kevin",POSTER,Social Psychology##Mental Health and Wellbeing,"<p></p><p>This study examined the influence of social media on mental wellbeing and social identity. Adolescence is the most vulnerable time to develop mental health issues, with 50% of disorders present in adulthood emerging before the age of 18. This is a major concern due to the long lasting consequences they can have, significantly impacting academic achievement, quality of life and personal relationships. However, there are a number of barriers to treatment, such as social isolation and challenging life circumstances, that limit the effectiveness of appropriate interventions. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore an alternative form of mental health support by focusing on the potential benefits of social media on adolescent’s wellbeing. Through semi-structured interviews, participants were asked about their experience on social media and mental health services available to them, as well as their help-seeking behaviour online.

Children’s racial preference for a skin tone similar to their own ,"PATERSON, Helena",TALK,Social Psychology,"<p></p><p>This study examines if children have an in-group preference for a skin tone that is similar to their own. This was examined because if children were found to have a preference for a skin tone similar to their own, then this would highlight that children naturally associate more with others that are racially alike to themselves. This was studied through drawings, where the children were given an option of two human outlines of a darker or lighter skin tone and asked to draw a superhero. The children were then asked additional questions, including who their favourite superhero was, to identify if children also have a racial preference with existing characters. If racial preference is found to be significant, then the conclusions of this study will be able to encourage even more representation within media platforms such as television and movies, so that all children can find characters that they can racially associate with. </p><br />",,Sarah Hutchinson,2266558h

Differential Decay Rates Between Access and Phenomenal Consciousness,"HARVEY, Monika",POSTER,Cognitive Neuroscience,"<p></p><p>The
current research concerns access (AC) and phenomenal consciousness (PC). Colour-diversity

Plain packaging attempts to reduce those simulations and in turn, decrease the desire to purchase the drink. To test this intervention, 562 participants were assigned to one of the three groups: standard brand packaging, transparent bland packaging (bottles with plain white labels) and opaque bland packaging (brown-green cans with brand names), and were asked to answer questions about consuming sugary drinks in different scenarios.

Effects of alpha-band entrainment on perception: Evidence from short-train transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS),"THUT, Gregor",POSTER,Cognitive Psychology (including language)##Cognitive Neuroscience,"<p></p><p>Subjective visual perception is shaped by awareness
levels and decision-making processes, which are associated with parietal cortex’s oscillators
at frequency alpha (i.e., 8-14Hz). Nevertheless, it seems that evidence is lacking
to infer a causal relationship between cortical excitability patterns and subjective
visual functions. As such, the present study investigated TMS-related changes of
a-neurons parietal activity
of 20 healthy volunteers under three conditions (i.e., sham, arrhythmic and rhythmic
TMS). EEG recordings and a detection task, involving near-threshold Gaussian
patches, assessed neuronal entrainment, performance accuracy and perceptual
awareness. In rhythmic-TMS condition only, successful entrainment of  æ-oscillators
is expected to decrease subjective awareness when stimuli were presented on the
contralateral side to the stimulation. Moreover, the closer the individual
alpha frequency (IAF) was to the stimulation’s frequency (i.e., 10Hz), the greater
the behavioural effects of entrainment are predicted. To verify such hypotheses,
an ANOVA will compare behavioural measures across conditions of stimulus and
stimulation, and post-hoc regression analysis will evaluate the relationship
between IAF and behavioural effect-size.</p><br />",,Marine Fleury,2268396f

Effects of alpha oscillaitons on visual perception: evidence from audio-visual entrainment,"THUT, Gregor",TALK,Cognitive Neuroscience,"<p></p><p>Distinct human brain oscillations recorded over posterior sites have been linked to specific aspects of perception and attention. One particular oscillation, the occipito-parietal alpha rhythm (~8-14 Hz), has been associated with changes in cortical excitability and its power and phase found to predict whether upcoming stimuli will be detected or not. However, more recent studies have provided converging evidence that pre-stimulus alpha power might influence the decision confidence, rather than perceptual sensitivity, by showing that alpha activity correlates with subjective perceptual experience but not with discrimination accuracy. Whether the relationship between pre-stimulus alpha power and subjective measures of performance is causal is still unclear. With the present project, we aim to investigate the nature of this relationship by transiently manipulating alpha power and phase. We plan to interact with brain activity by trains of audio-visual stimuli to entrain, i.e. progressively enhance, alpha oscillations using paired audio-visual stimulus of 10Hz. <span>The effects on visual perception will be measured by objective accuracy, and subjective </span>confidence<span> ratings.

Are there gender differences in resilience which can predict mental health?,"KILBORN, Kerry",POSTER,Mental Health and Wellbeing,"<p></p><p></p><p>This study investigates
whether gender differences in resilience exist which can predict mental health.
The effect of gender and resilience on mental health is important as it may be
relevant to clinical interventions. This could explain the variation in
diagnostic rates of mental illness between men and women. We could learn that
resilience or specific dimensions of resilience should be targeted in men/women
to improve mental wellbeing. Participants were asked to complete two
standardised scales: Resilience Scale for Adults (RSA) and Mental Health
Continuum Short Form (MHC-SF). We expect to find gender differences in
resilience or certain aspects of resilience which in turn predict mental
wellbeing. To identify gender differences in resilience, RSA overall scores and
scores for the six components between two levels (male/female) will be compared
using independent sample t-tests. Multiple regression analysis will be
conducted to establish whether gender and resilience can effectively predict
mental health.</p>",,Mari Jamshidi,2223836j
Does reading about climate change increase death thought accessibility? Integrating climate change communication with terror management theory,"BARSALOU, Larry",TALK,Social Psychology,"<p></p><p>Climate change (CC) communication commonly results in counter-productive bi-partisan attitude polarisation, which may be attributable to worldview defence mechanisms caused by heightened death awareness. This study for the first time examines whether exposure to threatening climate change information increases death thought accessibility (DTA), and whether increases in DTA can account for polarisation on a CC attitude measure. Participants read one of three news articles – discussing CC as a threat (threat), CC as a solvable problem (positive) or a CC unrelated topic (control). DTA was then measured using a word fragment completion task containing six ambiguous fragments that could be completed in either a death-related or a neutral way (e.g. COFF_ _ can be completed as COFFIN or COFFEE). Participants also indicated their attitudes towards government action against CC before and after reading the news article. We expect participants in the threat condition to show increased DTA and greater CC attitude polarisation than those in the positive or the control condition. </p><br />",,Marion Prieler,2270524p
Influence of Sustainability on Preference- Based Decision Making,"PHILIASTIDES, Marios",POSTER,Other,"<p></p><p><span>Sustainability
has become an important influence on consumer choice. Thus, the purpose of this
study is to investigate how information on sustainability affects consumer
purchasing behaviours. The participants rated clothing items based
on their personal preferences. Then, they completed a preference-based decision-making
task, which consisted of choosing amongst two different clothing items. In half
of the trials information on the items’ sustainability was also presented. In
the end, participants completed a self-reported questionnaire where they
revealed their attitudes and behaviours towards sustainability. The results suggest
that information on sustainability and consumer preferences are integrated into
a single source of evidence during the decision-making process. Therefore,
suggesting that sustainability plays a crucial role in consumer purchasing
behaviours as a result of the sustainability bias affecting the decision-making
process. The findings of this study may
have major implications not only on understanding how sustainability
information alters consumer choices, but also in prospective marketing
strategies.</span></p>

Mental health help-seeking attitudes in men in male-dominated professions: The role of stigma and masculinity.,"MARTIN, Margaret",POSTER,Mental Health and Wellbeing,"<p></p><p dir=""ltr"">Mental health problems are often unrecognised and untreated among men which may be explained by their help-seeking behaviours. The stigma associated with mental illness and men’s conformity to traditional masculine norms have been shown to negatively influence men’s attitudes towards help-seeking. Hyper-masculine environments such as male-dominated workplaces may be particularly vulnerable to the negative effects associated with traditional masculinity as they are often characterised as possessing a “macho” culture. The current study utilises the Implicit Associations Test to measure stigma towards mental illness, comparing men from male-dominated occupations and neutral workforces. Both groups completed the newly developed Masculinity Contest Cultures scale to assess the endorsement of masculine norms in their work environment followed by the Attitudes Towards Seeking Professional Psychological Help scale. It is expected that men from male-dominated professions will possess more stigmatising attitudes towards mental illness and hold less favourable attitudes towards psychological help-seeking. </p><p dir=""ltr""> </p><br /><br /><br />",,Ayesha Ali,2052047a
"Sleepy Students: Piloting a Sleep Intervention for Sleep, Stress, Anxiety & Depression ","BIELLO, Stephany",TALK,Mental Health and Wellbeing,"<p></p><p>As poor sleep and mental health difficulties are ubiquitous amongst higher education students, this study aimed to pilot whether a tailored Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Insomnia (CBTi) intervention is effective in the reduction of sleep difficulties and mental wellbeing (depression, stress &amp; anxiety) in university students.  Additionally, while no previous studies have investigated the efficacy of individual modules of CBTi on improving student sleep and mental wellbeing, this study assess the efficacy of Cognitive Behavioural components (CB) and Sleep Education (SE) components of CBTi. Nineteen university students attended a group CBTi Sleep Intervention Session and were then randomly assigned to receive digitalised CB or SE CBTi material.  All participants completed sleep diaries and wore accelerometers for the duration of the study (10 weeks), along with completing mental wellbeing questionnaire pertaining to stress, anxiety and depression at baseline, mid-point and upon completion of the study. It is expected that objective and subjective sleep will improve for all students, with a greater increase in those receiving digitalised CB.  Similarly, global improvements in all mental wellbeing measures are predicted, with those receiving CB materials exhibiting greater improvements compared to participants receiving SE. </p><p> </p><br />",,Jessica Lynch,2258396l
Quantifying Rhythm in Speech,"BARR, Dale",POSTER,Cognitive Psychology (including language),"<p>

</p><p>This study aimed to examine the nature of the rhythmicity in natural speech, in a sample of students from the University of Glasgow. It considered whether the rhythmic structure occurs globally over time, with one master frequency, or if there are multiple rhythmic centres, with rhythmicity occurring on a local level. The experiment employed quantitative measures exclusively and involved the use of a sensorimotor task through a ‘tapping’ device while a series of speech excerpts were played auditorily. Exploratory analysis of the tapping signal will be carried out and the variance in tempo between participants will be measured for the sensorimotor data. This measure will then be correlated with tempo estimates from the corresponding speech excerpts. These results will be analysed using R-studio software and the implications of this research discussed.</p>

The Processing of Scottish Names by Scottish Folk,"BARR, Dale",POSTER,Cognitive Psychology (including language),"<p></p><p>In psycholinguistics, it is a well-known fact that people are faster to process common words. Indeed, the cortical processing immediately triggered after hearing a stimulus, such as a name, is influenced by the listener’s personal history. A name’s commonality relies on the subject’s proximity and frequency of exposure to said word. The present study investigated whether an individual’s personal experience with names, shapes their corresponding processing speed. Data will be collected from a Scottish sample whose reaction time and eye-movements will be assessed, by an eye-tracking device and a mouse recorder. The set of names presented to participants will vary according to the individuals’ year of birth to represent potential differences in commonality across years. Names having been more frequently present during the participants’ childhood are expected to be more quickly processed than uncommon ones. The relative distinctiveness of common names and uncommon names is discussed, and further investigation is proposed.</p><p> </p><p> </p><br />",,Timo Schnabl,2249227s
Alpha-band entrainment effects on visual discrimination and subjective perceptual experience: Evidence from short-train transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS),"THUT, Gregor",TALK,Cognitive Neuroscience,"<p></p><p>Background:</p><p>Different aspects of human perception and attention have been linked to posterior brain oscillations. The occipito-parietal alpha rhythm (~8-14 Hz) is modulated by visual spatial attention. Its phase and power have been found to be predictive of the detection of upcoming visual stimulus. In previous studies, non-invasive short TMS pulse trains were used to effectively entrain alpha oscillations in the parietal region. Specifically, pre-stimulus alpha oscillation entrainment in posterior regions has been shown to selectively impair target detection contralaterally to the stimulated hemisphere but enhance it ipsilaterally. However, recent studies claim that pre-stimulus alpha power correlates with decision confidence rating rather than visual discrimination accuracy. </p><p><span>The main aim of this study is to directly manipulate alpha power and phase using TMS pulse trains to learn about the relationship between pre-stimulus alpha and both objective and subjective visual perceptual experiences.</span></p><p> </p><p>Methods:</p><p>20 healthy volunteers came into the TMS laboratory for two sessions of the experiment. All participants had undergone the same conditions and completed 300 visual perception task trials. The task involved discriminating whether a near-threshold (50% individual detection rate) visual stimulus appeared as a lighter or a darker patch on a grey computer screen background. After selecting their answer, participants were asked to rate their confidence of a perceived stimulus on the Perceptual Awareness Scale. EEG recordings from 3 scalp electrodes (O1, Oz, O2) were obtained during the whole experiment and TMS pulse trains were applied over the right parietal cortex based on individual MRI scans.

Death anxiety and Mindfulness,"KILBORN, Kerry",POSTER,Individual Differences##Other,"<p><span>This study aims to examine the difference in the effects of a mindfulness induction on proximal defence responses to mortality salience between participants with previous exposure to mindful techniques compared to those who are novel to mindfulness. Participants were split into two groups, on the basis of having previous experience with yoga, meditation or mindfulness: previous-exposure (n = 25), and those who were novel (n = 25). All participants (N = 50) underwent a mindful-meditation induction and mortality salient induction after experimental manipulation, involving a written exercise pertaining to one’s death. It is expected to find higher levels of trait-mindfulness and fewer proximal responses in the previous-exposure group compared to the novel group. This would show that those with more experience in mindfulness, can better utilize the mindful-meditation induction, thus buffer against death anxiety and respond with less deniability and suppression of death thoughts (proximal defences), showing an open, accepting perspective to death.</span><br /></p>",,Jasmin Turner,2248195t

The effect of sleep quality on oral presentation skills at University,"BIELLO, Stephany",POSTER,Social Psychology##Other,"<p></p><p> </p><p>The majority of students in the UK report getting less than 7 hours of sleep every night. This has knock-on effects for their mental and physical health. There is a significant association between sleep quality and intrapersonal adjustment at university- those who have poorer sleep will feel maladjusted compared to their peers. Communication skills also suffer- the literature suggests that those who don’t get regular good quality sleep will seem less desirable, and their peers will be less likely to socialise with them. However, are these poor communication skills reflected in graded assessments as well as social situations? The present research aims to assess if there is a link between poor sleep and communication skills during presentations at university. 40 students completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index evaluating their cumulative sleep quality. They were then assessed on their presentation skills during an oral assessment- notably their body language, confidence, and voice projection. </p><br />",,Leigh Tweedlie,2257293t
